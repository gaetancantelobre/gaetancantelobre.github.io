                <h2>26 MINUTES FLIGHT TIME at FULL POWER under 100g?</h2>
            
                <p>I find the 1s build much more interesting if we consider that we are flying at maximum current draw (in this
                    case +- 8 A at 3.7 V).
                    Using the 3500 mAh cell we can estimate a theoretical max flight duration of: <b>26 minutes</b> (3.5/8x60). For
                    a sub-100 g flying vehicle I find that quite impressive.
                    If the wind is low I think that flight time is very possible. That being said I'm a decent FPV quad pilot but I
                    not
                    as good with a fixed wing.

                <h4>Energy density Li-ion vs Li-Po</h4>
                <p>These 18650 cells are super interesting if you compare the energy density to classic drone batteries (Li-Po) :
                    if we calculate the mass/energy (mAh) of a 1s LiPo and 1s Li-ion.
                    I took one of my 1s 450mAh Li-po : 13.5g and a 18650 3500mAh Li-on : 34g.<br>
                    Li-Po : <b>33.3 mAh/g</b> && Li-ion : <b>102.9 mAh/g</b>.<br>
                    The results speak for themselves.</p>

                <h4>But what about for 2 cells (7.4V)? </h4>
                <p>
            
                    Li-Po : 2s 450mAh 28g<br>
                    Li-Ion : 2x 18650 3500mah 68g<br>
                    Li-Po : <b>16.0 mAh/g</b> && Li-ion : <b>51.4 mAh/g</b>.<br>

                <h4> What does this mean?</h4>
            
                <p>
                    Both Li-Ion and Li-Po are a great choice for RC applications.
                    Regardless of the calculations above LiPo and Li-ion tend to have similar energy densities.
                    They both have their uses. Li-po's have a higher C rating (faster discharge) but can be harder to charge and
                    store.
                    Li-ion are denser and smaller making them better for long-range and autonomous flight.<br>
                    If you want to see a decent comparison (laking a bit of math IMO) check this out :

                <h4> 1 hour flight time under 100g on a delta-wing ?</h4>
                <p>
                    Since we can get (in theory) close de 25 minutes of flight time. Can we get 25 more with another cell
                    onboard?<br>
                    How close can we get to 1 hour flight time while under 100g? Obviously, with a motor glider build, this is done
                    and done again.
                    But what about a delta wing?
                </p>
                <h5> Is it possible? Under 100 grams? </h5>
            
            
                <p>
                    I believe with some smart flying, (spiraling up and gliding down using minimal thrust to save some mAh) we could
                    get closer to 35 to 40 minutes.
                    We could rely on computer-aided flight with systems like ArduPilot but that would mean we would need an ID chip,
                    a GPS, and a flight controller that is capable of running at 3.7V (or add a boost converter). This adds more
                    weight and with only <b>17g to spare</b>...
                    The 1s version is around 83 grams, if we add 34g for an extra cell, we get to 117g which is over our limit.
                </p>
            
            
                <h5> A more pratical vision.</h5>
            
                <p>
                    I really think that 1 hour flight time is possible with my current build. As the previous calculations are at
                    max esc draw, in reality, the 1104 motors with a 3018 prop only pull <b>4.2 A</b> at full throttle.<br>
                    So if we redo our calculations: 3.5 / 4.2 = 0.83 hours = <b>50 minutes.</b> <br>
                    Now we are close to our objective! Knowing that the plane will fly without being on full throttle, I
                    estimate that this goal is already achievable with the current setup.<br>
                    That is in good to perfect conditions, having a light plane is great for endurance. The delta-wing profile does
                    not have a rudder, giving it almost null rudder authority.<br> This puts the model to the mercy of the wind
                    assuring the need for larger / longer corrections therefore less time in optimized flight.<br>
                </p>
            
            
                <h5> How can I save weight or flight time ?</h5>
            
                <p>
                    I could save a couple of grams by removing the FPV system but it wouldn't make that much of a difference.
                    I can surely save weight on hot glue (i tend to use too much :) ). The real evolution will be made when I can
                    pilot better.
                    I'm not at the point where the final flight time will be affected by a couple of grams but more by my skill in
                    endurance-style flying.
                </p>
            
                <h4> What is the next challenge? Is the skies the limit?</h5>
            
                    <p>
                        Sadly no, the sky isn't the limit. If I challenged myself to 2 hours under 150g other limitations would
                        occur. Too heavy, less lift, demanding higher power draw, another motor? Another ESC? It's an endless
                        loophole.<br>
                        Space is another consideration to take into account. I can bearly fit 1 cell and the rest of the equipment,
                        i
                        couldn't imagine where I could safely fit another cell.<br>
                        I had thought of inserting the cells in the wings. Some quick tests showed that the cell's weight would
                        cause
                        sag in the wing in turn ruining the profile of the wings.<br>
                        The structure could be rendered more rigid with some 2mm carbon rods but more rigid means more fragile which
                        cause other issues.
                        I think that the objective is possible but not on such a small frame and probably not on a delta wing.
