             I had some nostalgic thoughts about some childhood games I had and one of them was the Simon color game. It would give you a forever growing <b>sequence of colors</b>,<br>
             and you had to <b>restore them in the correct order</b>. There was no winning or losing just who would get the highest score.
             The project was a bit simple in justifying ordering PCBs and making a full product. So I challenged myself to <b>make it as small as possible</b> (with a pre-built microcontroller).
             This was the perfect opportunity to test out SMD soldering. Components that are soldered to the surface of the PCB and not through a hole in the board. This generally makes for a small footprint.<br>
             A good example of this is the LEDs I'm using. The classic LED is 5mm wide and 7mm tall, and the SMD version is a 1206 standard LED with <b>3.20mm x 1.60mm</b>.<br>
             Easy to say that when you drop them because you will, they are gone forever finding them on the floor is a painstaking experience.
             </p>

             <p>
             Since the components are quite small it's not an easy task to solder them with a soldering iron as the pads are very small.
             To accommodate such small surface areas, instead of trying to heat a small portion of the board, we use a <b>reflow plate / preheating plate</b> to heat the whole PCB to a "lower" temperature.<br>
             Using a lower melting point solder paste <b>(130 C)</b> we can heat the whole board and preplace the parts and the solder paste and just watch as the solder melts and adheres to the pads and components.
             It's not as simple as just melting and cooling down the solder. A specific <b>heat curve</b> must be used to ensure the correct bonding of the solder.<br>
             First, the flux must be melted and given time to spread on the pads, same for the solder, wait for the heat to disperse to avoid cold joints.<br>

             A project is never done without some 3D printing and PCB design (which I've already covered). Not all the components are SMD, so there are some point bits on the backside.
             That is why I decided to make a quick 3D-printed case so it wouldn't snag on my pockets.

            <p> Overall such a fun little conversation starter.<br> I may remake one using an esp32, as we could imagine having a local MQTT server running to receive the scores of each game. To have the high score stored somewhere.</p>
