                <h2>Tilt Indicator</h2>
                <h4> Skills : <b>PCB Design</b>, <b>CAD</b>, <b>Embedded systems</b>, <b>Product production</b></h4>
                <p>
                    One of my relatives is involved in competitive shooting and the cost of a shooting level is well into
                    the
                    hundreds of euros.
                    So I challenged myself to build a low-cost Arduino-based shooting level and even if it is a bit large, I
                    believe that I have completed my challenge.
                    In the future, I may redesign it and make a single-board version for a smaller footprint.
                </p>
    
    
                <p> Arduino Nano based tilt indicator using a MPU6050 3-axis accelerometer and 3-axis gyroscope. Made
                    for
                    competitive shooters and airsoft use.
                    The precision can be set in software as well as the mounting offset for the most precise experience. The
                    first interaction on a breadboard used an OLED screen but through the feedback of the shooters, they
                    wanted something that they could read in their peripheral vision.
                    The current version uses 5 LEDs to indicate the direction and amplitude of the tilt. The base setting is
                    precise to 3 degrees but can be cranked down to less.
                    It can be powered through a 2S lipo battery or by USB.
                    Designed in KiCad and produced with JLBPCB.
                    For mounting I've designed a variety of mounts, from flat mounts to Picatinny rail mounts

                <h2>Airsoft Defusing Game</h2>
                <p>
                    In the context of my weekend airsoft events, some admins of these events allow players to offer
                    scenarios and props to make the games more interesting.
                    My field already had a fake bomb but it was as simple as screwing a light bulb or flipping a switch. So
                    I set out to make a more interactive bomb prop.
                    I made my first "large" Arduino prototype. Then designed for the first time a PCB and produced it. The
                    design is filled with problems, the circuit can be easily damaged: while "defusing the bomb" if you put
                    the wires on the wrong connections you can short circuit.
                    The is no reverse polarity protection, the Arduino Nano has its own but it can stop the use and abuse
                    that an airsoft player can produce. (This problem was taken into account in my future projects).
                    I ended up stopping the production as it was too complicated and they would break over and over again.
                    There was also the fact that they ran on LiPo batteries which created a dangerous situation especially
                    because of the lack of security features.
                    I wish to showcase this project as a reminder of my beginnings and the errors I've made to continue to
                    better my current designs.
                </p>
    
    
                <p>
                    Arduino Nano-based airsoft scenario prop, where the user chooses an order in which wires have to be
                    removed or
                    the bomb will go "off" (its a toy, not a weapon). Powered by USB or 2s LiPo.
