            <p>
                This page is dedicated to all of my FPV/RC projects !
                Here you can see what RC 'toys' I've been running with.
                I've been flying FPV since 2016. Mostly 5 inches quads, but as European regulations have become more
                strict
                most of my old quads have become illegal. So I've been moving to under 250g quads and other flying objects to
                stay
                legal.
                They are easy to transport as well. You can often see me on my campus flying in vacant parks as some FatShark
                goggles, a 3-inch quad or a whoop, a Radiomaster Zorro and some 2S batteries easily fit in my school bag.
            </p>

                <h2>My daily drivers</h2>
            
            <p>For all of my RC projects, I'm running a Radiomaster Zorro and a pair of FatShark Dominators V2 HD's.</p>

                    And the other is running on a single 18650 3500 mAh Li-ion cell.

            <h2>NBD Tiny Whoop </h2>
            
            <p> A sub 35g 1s tiny whoop with 31mm props.
                This thing is just too fun, super powerful, batteries are super cheap, fast to charge.
                This is the first "Bind'n Fly" quad and i think it will be my last... <br>
                First of all I enjoy building my quads but also because I had a hard time getting the built-in ELRS module to work.<br>
                And in the end i didn't, i had to by a new ELRS module to get this thing of the ground. The issue was due to the fact that the FC was sent with the wrong firmware.<br>
                Flashing a new firmware isn't an unknown task for me but the correct firmware was not available on their github, and tech support said it would be available in a couple months so...<br>
                I can fly this thing in my appartement (18m²) and have fun. It's too light to hurt or damage anything or it's self.<br>
                Since the propellers and motors are in ducts, i don't have to worry about damaging the props, i got a bunch of spares but i can't imagine needing to change them any time soon!<br>

            <h2>NOOPY</h2>
            
            <p>
                A 64g (with a 450mAh 2S) 3-inch quad.
                With all the spare parts, a carry case, and 5 packs, we are at a <i>wooping</i> 240g.
                Easy to say that I have it on me all the time. (The carrying case is a McDonalds makeup bag)

                Fun little quad you can fly pretty much everywhere, the smaller quads seem to grow on me, so much
                more practical.
