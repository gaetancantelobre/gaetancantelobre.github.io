            <h2>RoboCup SSL Blackout Challenge (university project)</h2>
            <h4> Skills : <b>AI</b>, <b>Computer vision</b>, <b>Pathfinding</b>, ,<b>Decision making</b></h4>
            <h3>Challenge description and context.</h3>

            <p>
                During the first year of my master's me and 2 other had to choose a programming challenge and complete it while simulating how a company works : meetings, objectives releases etc.
                We choose a challenge offered by Patrick Felix a teacher at IUT de Bordeaux. His challenge was an attempt at the RoboCup SSL Blackout Challenge
                 (<a href="https://robocup-ssl.github.io/technical-challenge-rules/2022-ssl-vision-blackout-rules.pdf">Full description</a>).
                TLDR : We have wheel powered robots playing a simplified version of soccer. Normaly an overhead camera identifies the robot and the ball and controls them accordingly.
                In our challenge these robots have to be 100% independant.<br>
                There was different level of challenges :
                <ul>
                    <li>Find and recognize objects on the field (robots,ball,goals). <b>COMPLETED</b></li>
                    <li>Find , move to, and kick the ball. <b>COMPLETED</b></li>
                    <li>Find ball, and score a goal. <b>COMPLETED</b></li>
                    <li> Score a goal by passing the ball to an ally. <b>UNCOMPLETED</b></li>
                </ul>    
                We were constrainted to use a Nvidia Jetson Nano as part of the challenge.
                
            </p>

            <h3>How the challenge was completed.</h3>


            <p>
                The challenges were completed using a webcam strapped to the robot, a custom YOLOV8 model that we trained on elements of the "soccer field".
                Using our YOLOV8 model we were able to identify objects and there size allowing to make a simple search and meet algorithm.
                Knowing the size of objects in pixels at a certain distance allows us to estimate their size at all pixel size allowing to adjust for shot power and approach speed.
                Some notable challenges were object permenance as well as the control of the robot through the <a href="https://robot-soccer-kit.com/">RSK</a> API.
