            <h2>QMK MacroPad</h2>
            <p>Multilayer macropad using QMK firmware and AutoHotKey script easily open webpages, applications and
                manage active media. Boosting a full custom pcb, 9 assignable buttons, close to limitless amount of
                layers to increase the number of available binds.
                For better feedback on the current binds and layer of the macropad a 128 x 32 pixel I2C OLED screen is
                situated at the top, indicating the current setup and changing at each level change.
                For the brains (micro controller) i use the classic Arduino Pro Micro for its high GPIO count and small
                footprint.
                PCB was desgined in KiCad and produced with JLBPCB.

            <h2>Tilt Indicator</h2>
            <p> Arduino Nano based tilt indicator using a MPU6050 3-axis accelerometer and 3-axis gyroscope. Made for
                competive shooters and airsoft use.
                The precision can be set in software as well as the mounting offset for the most precise experience. The
                first iteraction on a breadboard used a OLED screen but htrough the feedback of the shooters, they
                wanted something that they could read in the peripheral vision.
                The current version uses 5 leds to indicate the direction and amplitude of the tilt. The base setting is
                precise to 3 degrees but can be cranked down to less.
                It can be power through a 2s lipo battery or by usb.
                Designed in KiCad and produced with JLBPCB.
                For mounting I've designed a variety of mounts, from flat mounts to picatinny rail mounts </p>

            <h2>Airsoft Defusing Game</h2>
            <p>
                Arduino Nano based airsoft scenario prop, where user choses a order in which wires have to be removed or
                the bomb will go "off" (its a toy not a weapon). Powered by usb or 2s LiPo.
